      <description>Rirespira is a website made for facilitating environmentally friendly choices. Think of it like a PokeDex for the environmental impact of actions.

      <description>So, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while. It&amp;rsquo;s been more than a month, in fact, since the last time I committed anything to my Rirespira git repository, which includes planning documents.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite busy to say the least; since my last commit I have moved to a new continent and started a 6-month internship which will keep me busy here until the beginning of February.
Moving to a new continent, on my own, where the language spoken is neither Italian nor English, has definitely taken up quite a bit of my time and energy.</description>

      <title>Rirespira DevBlog 2 | The Tech Stack</title>

      <description>So I have somewhat introduced the concept behind Rirespira, but how will it be implemented from a technological point of view?
Rirespira will be a website. With the mobile app market dying down, frameworks becoming more and more suitable for mobile web development and internet connectivity becoming increasingly accessible, for me it only makes sense for most projects be web-based.
The nature of a browser-based Rirespira will require a front-end, a back-end and a database before being deployed, like most dynamic websites.</description>

      <description>For the last three years I have been living in the UK, particularly up north in Durham where the climate throughout the year doesn&amp;rsquo;t really lend itself to a strong agricultural economy when it comes to vegetables other than potatoes and carrots.
The result is the presence of a huge proportion of imported vegetables in supermarkets, often from across the Atlantic and often packaged in plastic to prolong their shelf life.</description>

      <description>There is a &amp;ldquo;syndrome&amp;rdquo; I suffer from that could easily be called &amp;ldquo;nebulous thoughts syndrome&amp;rdquo;. In a way, you could describe it as daydreaming. While cooking, showering, walking to classes, walking in general or while doing whatever other random activity, I very often catch my mind drifting, thinking about all sorts of different matters.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure we all get caught up in this but for me it ends up being relatively frustrating - I find that because of the hazy nature of these inner discussions, they often do not find any solid conclusions, simply morphing into new topics, often overly emotionally influenced and opinionated, lacking any form of fact-checking and structure.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Giulio Starace &amp;ndash; welcome to my personal website.
I&amp;rsquo;m a recent Physics and Computer Science graduate from Durham University in the North-East of England. Originally from Rome, Italy, I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in a variety of different places growing up thanks to my parents&amp;rsquo; jobs, which has granted me the privilege of experiencing a wide breadth of cultures from a very young age.
Greatly interested in technology, I&amp;rsquo;ve created this website to centrally document my adventure into the professional world, providing me with a space to share my thoughts, projects and achievements.</description>
