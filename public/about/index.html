<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Giulio Starace &ndash; welcome to my personal website.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a recent Physics and Computer Science graduate from Durham University in the North-East of England. Originally from Rome, Italy, I&rsquo;ve lived in a variety of different places growing up thanks to my parents&rsquo; jobs, which has granted me the privilege of experiencing a wide breadth of cultures from a very young age.</p>

<p>Greatly interested in technology, I&rsquo;ve created this website to centrally document my adventure into the professional world, providing me with a space to share my thoughts, projects and achievements. I use the word <em>adventure</em> because I&rsquo;m not really sure where I&rsquo;m going and that&rsquo;s <em>okay</em>.</p>

<p>My background is mainly that of a Physics undergraduate, but I know I don&rsquo;t want to further pursue the subject academically. Instead, I&rsquo;m making use of a year of internships, side-projects and general reflection to solidify my software development skills and more importantly clear my mind about really what I want to do with my life, particularly which aspect of Computer Science to dedicate myself to for an upcoming Masters course.</p>

<p>Apart from these more &ldquo;serious&rdquo; matters, I&rsquo;m also quite in love <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/thesofakillers?si=kWtQZOZjRQCpYb-AhcIT6Q">with</a> <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/giuliostarace">music</a>. While perhaps more of a listener, I&rsquo;m also a decent singer and have been self-teaching myself guitar since the age of 16 (very slowly). My main sport is football, having played it ever since I was 5, but I definitely won&rsquo;t turn down a hike, some snowboarding or (if my forearms manage) some rock-climbing. If i&rsquo;m struggling to find people to exercise with, I&rsquo;ll force myself to go for a run from time to time. I&rsquo;ve also developed a passion for cooking ever since I&rsquo;ve moved away from the cocoon. I used to be quite into photography and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GiulioStarace">filmography</a> having participated in youth competitions during school but now with the advent of smartphone cameras the hobby has somewhat dwindled. That being said I <em>do</em> like to take my mobile photography relatively <a href="https://instagram.com/thesofakillers">seriously</a>.</p>

<p>I think that should probably be enough for an About Me page. More info will probably seep in through blog posts so I will leave it there. Thank you and enjoy!</p>

<h1 id="about-this-site">About this site</h1>

<p>I made this site using a static site generator, namely <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, based on <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a> by Google. I chose to use a static site generator because it in my view provides the right level of compromise between building from scratch (I&rsquo;m not the best at making things look <em>ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ</em> through CSS/HTML) and CMS (seemed like overkill and I&rsquo;ve had bad experiences using WordPress). I chose Hugo mostly through word of mouth and was particularly drawn by its speed, simplicity and markdown integrations. I also thought it would expose me to Golang forcing me to learn some of it but so far it has been basically absent. The theme is <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/cocoa/">Cocoa</a> by Nishanth Shanmugham.</p>
