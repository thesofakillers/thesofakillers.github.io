      <description>There is a &amp;ldquo;syndrome&amp;rdquo; I suffer from that could easily be called &amp;ldquo;nebulous thoughts syndrome&amp;rdquo;. In a way, you could describe it as daydreaming. While cooking, showering, walking to classes, walking in general or while doing whatever other random activity, I very often catch my mind drifting, thinking about all sorts of different matters.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure we all get caught up in this but for me it ends up being relatively frustrating - I find that because of the hazy nature of these inner discussions, they often do not find any solid conclusions, simply morphing into new topics, often overly emotionally influenced and opinionated, lacking any form of fact-checking and structure.</description>
