Hi, I'm Giulio, welcome to my personal website!

I was born about {{% age %}} years ago in Rome, Italy, but I'm actually one of those weird [third-culture kids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid), having lived in a [few different places](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ByVrBiG0zU4PPVqlGd1QQJbR2gzAq-Bc&usp=sharing) while growing up due to my parents job.

I guess you'd expect someone with that sort of upbringing to make use of their experience to build in career in international relations or modern languages. While I do find languages fascinating, I've always been a science, tech and future enthusiast which is part of why I decided to study [Physics](https://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/undergraduate/courses/bscphys/) at university, switching to [Computer Science and Physics](http://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/php/natural.sciences.php?dept1=comp&dept2=phys&programme=jh_bsc) after my first year.

As most Italian boys out there, I'm a huge football (the one where you [kick the ball with your foot](https://bit.ly/2M1qXlN)) [enthusiast](https://photos.app.goo.gl/SsdDuJXMuzuZEXkR7), having played the sport since age 5. I also really love [hiking](https://bit.ly/2YXRghV) in nature, [snowboarding](https://bit.ly/2LXGZwP), and I'm trying to get more into camping and rock-climbing.

I'm also quite in [love](https://open.spotify.com/user/thesofakillers?si=kWtQZOZjRQCpYb-AhcIT6Q) with [music](https://www.last.fm/user/giuliostarace). While perhaps more of a listener, I'm also a decent singer and have been self-teaching myself guitar since the age of 16 (very slowly). My favourite artists are [Radiohead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead) and [The Doors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doors) but it varies a lot. I've also developed a passion for [cooking](https://bit.ly/35uRLmi) ever since I've moved away from the cocoon and I've recently started to rekindle my interest in photography, which i pursue through my [two](https://instagram.com/thesofakillers) instagram [pages](https://instagram.com/luxannorum).

I think that should probably be enough for an About Me page. The purpose of this website is to officially collect information on myself in a single place, which I can also use as a platform for [blogging](/posts/why-blog) and my [portfolio](/projects/). More info will probably seep in through other pages so I will leave it there. Thank you!
