Hi, I'm Giulio, welcome to my personal website!

I am currently a Master's student at the University of Amsterdam, studying
Artificial Intelligence. In particular, I am interested in prompted
multi-{modal/lingual} large language models (LLMs) and AI Safety. My current
thesis direction explores natural language interfaces for goal specification in
Reinforcement Learning.

Before the programme, I worked as a software engineer and researcher at a few
companies, and studied Physics and Computer Science at Durham University for my
Bachelors. You can find more info on this [on my cv](/cv/GiulioStarace_CV.pdf).

## A bit more about me

I was born about {{% age %}} years ago in Rome, Italy, but grew up in a few
other countries due to my parents' career. Outside of my studies, I'm like to
work on side projects, playing football, bouldering, hiking and playing the
piano and guitar not very well. I like to talk and think about AI, the future,
alternative ways of living, transport and city-planning. My favourite artists
are Monet, Caravaggio, Renoir and probably a few others. For what I listen to,
checkout my [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/giuliostarace) (it's probably
Radiohead). I want to learn more languages, how to make clothes, and how to
sail.

## This website

The purpose of this website is to officially collect information on myself in a
single place, which I can also use as a platform for
[blogging](/posts/why-blog/) and my [portfolio](/projects/). Thanks!
