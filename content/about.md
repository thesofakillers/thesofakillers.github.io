Hi, I'm Giulio, welcome to my homepage.

I'm currently contracting as a Research Engineer at
[OpenAI](https://openai.com), where I am working within
[Preparedness](https://openai.com/preparedness/) on model evaluations.

Before that, I finished my MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of
Amsterdam. In my [thesis](https://github.com/thesofakillers/nlgoals), I worked
on addressing goal misgeneralization in sequential decision making agents
through the use of natural language interfaces.

### A bit more about me

I was born about {{< age >}} years ago in Rome, Italy, but grew up in a few
other countries due to my parents' career. In my free time, I enjoying tinkering
on side projects, playing football, bouldering, hiking and playing the piano and
guitar not very well. I like to talk and think about AI, the future, alternative
ways of living, transport, city-planning and Italy. My favourite artistic period
is probably "Modern" (~ 1860 - 1945). For what I listen to, checkout my

my [goodreads](https://goodreads.com/thesofakillers). I want to learn more
languages, how to make clothes, and how to sail.
