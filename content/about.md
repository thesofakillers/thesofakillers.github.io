Hi, I'm Giulio, welcome to my personal website!

I'm currently contracting as a Research Engineer at
[OpenAI](https://openai.com), where I am working within the Policy research team
on an eval suite for assessing and tracking model capabilities.

Before that, I finished my MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of
Amsterdam. In my thesis, I worked on addressing goal misgeneralization in
sequential decision making agents through the use of natural language
interfaces.

I am interested in increasingly general large (multimodal) language models,
causality and AI safety, where I am focusing my career efforts right now.

## A bit more about me

I was born about {{< age >}} years ago in Rome, Italy, but grew up in a few
other countries due to my parents' career. In my free time, I enjoying tinkering
on side projects, playing football, bouldering, hiking and playing the piano and
guitar not very well. I like to talk and think about AI, the future, alternative
ways of living, transport, city-planning and Italy. My favourite artistic period
is probably "Modern" (~ 1860 - 1945). For what I listen to, checkout my
[last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/giuliostarace). I want to learn more
languages, how to make clothes, and how to sail.

## This website

The purpose of this website is to officially collect information on myself in a
single place, which I can also use as a platform for
[blogging](/posts/why-blog/) and my [portfolio](/projects/). Thanks!
