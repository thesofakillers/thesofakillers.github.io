Hi, I'm Giulio, welcome to my homepage.

Right now, I'm building ___ as cofounder. More on that coming soon.

Previously, I was at [OpenAI](https://openai.com), where I worked within
[Preparedness](https://openai.com/preparedness/) on model evaluations. See some
of our work [here](https://openai.com/index/paperbench/),
[here](https://openai.com/index/mle-bench/),
[here](https://openai.com/index/introducing-swe-bench-verified/) and
[here](https://github.com/openai/evals/).

Before that, I finished my MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of
Amsterdam. In my [thesis](https://github.com/thesofakillers/nlgoals), I worked
on addressing goal misgeneralization in sequential decision making agents
through the use of natural language interfaces.

### A bit more about me

I was born in Rome, Italy, but grew up in a few other countries due to my
parents' career. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering on side projects, playing
football, bouldering, reading and attempting to make and/or play music. I like
to talk and think about AI, the future, alternative ways of living, culture and
Italy. My favourite artistic period is probably "Modern" (~ 1860 - 1945). For
what I listen to, checkout my [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/giuliostarace).
For what I watch, checkout my
[letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/thesofakillers/). For what I read, checkout
my [goodreads](https://goodreads.com/thesofakillers). I want to learn more
languages, how to make clothes, and how to sail.

### This website

Inspired by [this website](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/), this website
is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) working off of
[this theme](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/).
