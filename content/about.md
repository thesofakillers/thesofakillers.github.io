Hi, I'm Giulio, welcome to my personal website!

I was born about {{% age %}} years ago in Rome, Italy, but I'm actually one of those weird [third-culture kids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid), having lived in a [few different places](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ByVrBiG0zU4PPVqlGd1QQJbR2gzAq-Bc&usp=sharing) while growing up due to my parents' job.

I guess you'd expect someone with that sort of upbringing to make use of their experience to build in career in international relations or modern languages. While I do find languages fascinating, I've always been a science, tech and future enthusiast which is part of why I decided to study [Physics](https://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/undergraduate/courses/bscphys/) at university, switching to [Computer Science and Physics](http://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/php/natural.sciences.php?dept1=comp&dept2=phys&programme=jh_bsc) after my first year.

After experiencing and enjoying a bit of the world of software development, at
the moment I'm trying to move my career towards research, particularly in the
field of Machine Learning, while keeping a door open to OSS development.

The purpose of this website is to officially collect information on myself in a single place, which I can also use as a platform for [blogging](/posts/why-blog) and my [portfolio](/projects/). More info will probably seep in through other pages so I will leave it there. Thank you!
