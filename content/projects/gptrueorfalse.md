[GPTrue or False](https://github.com/thesofakillers/GPTrue-or-False/) is a
browser extension available on both
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gptrue-or-false/bikcfchmnacmfhneafnpfekgfhckplfj?hl=en-GB)
and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gptrue-or-false/)
that displays the likelihood that a portion of selected text was generated by
[OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s
[GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/) model.

## How it Works

Having selected a portion of text comprising of at least 50 words, the user is
able to prompt the extension for an evaluation of the selected text. The
extension takes the selected text and passes it via an HTTP GET request to
[this webpage](https://huggingface.co/openai-detector) hosted publicly by
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) (check them out!). The webpage is an
interface to OpenAI's GPT-2
[Detector](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2-output-dataset/tree/master/detector)
model, which outputs the likelihood that inputted text was generated by GPT-2.

The response from the Hugging Face webpage is received by the extension, parsed
and neatly displayed under the selected text.

## In the press

The project received a surprising amount of attention, probably thanks to the
initial reactions from Andrej Karpathy and Brendan Eich Twitter.

The extension was later featured on a number of tech news websites including
[DigitalTrends](https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/gpt-2-plugin-sorts-real-from-fake/),
[LifeHacker](https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2019/11/automatically-detect-computer-generated-text-with-this-chrome-extension/),
[TechTheLead](https://techthelead.com/chrome-extension-tells-you-who-wrote-that-text-computer-or-human/),
among others.
