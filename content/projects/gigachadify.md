[gigachadify](https://github.com/thesofakillers/gigachadify) is a fun weekend
project where I made a simple CLI tool that takes any image of a face as input
and outputs a corresponding
"[gigachad](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gigachad)" meme of that face, using
machine learning models.

The work was mainly pulling out and simplifying the pipelines of interests from
[ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI).

The groupchat had a great time gigachadifying eachother.

You can install and try out gigachadify as shown on its
[GitHub page](https://github.com/thesofakillers/gigachadify)
