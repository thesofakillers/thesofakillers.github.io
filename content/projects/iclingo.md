iclingo is a [clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo/) kernel for
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) which I developed over a weekend when learning
about
[Answer set programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming)
at university, facing the desire of a smoother notebook programming experience.

The project is still bare-bones but is enough for an
[mvp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product). The kernel can be
installed via Pypi with `pip install iclingo`.

More information and code can be found
[on GitHub](https://github.com/thesofakillers/iclingo).
