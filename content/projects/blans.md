bLANS (better LaTeX on ANS) is a simple website I made with
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) to help me and my fellow classmates with
writing answers with LaTeX notation on the [ANS.app](https://ans.app/) grading
platform.

ANS uses a somewhat weird flavour of markdown for typesetting LaTeX. The idea
with bLANS is that you can write your answers in the more conventional
pandoc-style markdown in your editor of choice, such as VS code, and then when
you're ready to put your answers into ANS, you can quickly convert them to the
appropriate format with bLANS, which takes care of the weird LaTeX quirks
necessary.

You can try bLANS out [here](/bLANS) and read more about it
[on GitHub](https://github.com/thesofakillers/bLANS).
