"Posso Vaccinarmi" was a simple conditional-questionnaire website I developed
during the [COVID-19 Pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic)
to help fellow Italians figure out if they were eligible to receive a COVID-19
vaccine when the first doses were coming out.

I made this website due to frustration with information disseminated via
SEO-optimizing news articles and overly bureaucratic government websites, that
seemed to never get to the point.

Because the vaccine situation is generally much simpler now, the website is now
archived. You can try out an
[archived broken version of the website on archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20210213225411/https://possovaccinarmi.it/),
