vscode-pbtxt is a simple extension that I wrote for
[VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which enables
[Protocol Buffer Text Format](https://medium.com/@nathantnorth/protocol-buffers-text-format-14e0584f70a5)
syntax highlighting. The extension boasts roughly 14000 installs on the
[VisualStudio marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thesofakillers.vscode-pbtxt).

As I no longer use VS code after switching to
([neo](https://medium.com/@nathantnorth/protocol-buffers-text-format-14e0584f70a5))[vim](https://www.vim.org/),
I have merged the project with another user who had developed a similar one at
the same time. The [repository](https://github.com/thesofakillers/vscode-pbtxt)
is now archived.
