My [personal knowledge base](../knowledge-base) will no longer updated publicly.
That is, the [website](https://notes.giuliostarace.com) that I used to share my
notes will become stale. In fact, it already has been for more than a year. This
is for two reasons:

1. The main purpose of the original website was to provide me a way of
   visualizing my notes outside of vim. It being public was a bonus. I now use
   [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which exceeds my desiderata for note
   visualization.
2. I have found the current "digital-garden" ecosystem a bit too limited in
   achieving the balance between ease-of-use, flexibility and portability. These
   are requirements for whatever stack I would need for publishing my KB:
   - ease of use: I don't want to waste time tinkering on the visualization of
     my knowledge base. My Zettelkasten is for learning, not for tinkering.
   - portability and flexibility: this is just an echo of some of the key tenets
     of Zettelkasten. My notes need to last forever, so I can't rely on the
     structures of some arbitrary repository. The repository needs to be
     flexible enough (e.g. have support for relative links (rarer than you'd
     think!)) to accept a folder of my notes.

I continue to take notes, they just are no longer publicly available. Perhaps
one day I will find a solution when the ecosystem matures a little bit.

This was a quick blogpost with little proofreading. Just wanted to give an
update.
