Almost a year ago today, I was hastily finishing the motivational letter required for consideration in ESO's 2019 winter internship programme, just a few hours before the deadline.

A few days later, I was working through a Skype interview with my future supervisors.

Perhaps a week after that, I had secured a place as 6 month software engineering intern in the Information and Knowledge Management group at Paranal Observatory in the Atacama desert in Chile.

_Wow, that was fast._

Thrilled, and with frankly quite a bit of other things on my mind (I was in the midst of revision for my final undergraduate exams), I searched for articles, YouTube videos, blogposts, ANYTHING, discussing life at the observatory from a non-corporate, and ideally intern's point of view. Unfortunately, and perhaps unsurprisingly, I could not find anything.

Now that I've completed the internship, I hope this blogpost can provide some insight on what interning at Paranal Observatory is like, and hopefully attract future bright candidates to apply.

### Getting to Paranal

Paranal Observatory is in the Atacama Desert in Chile, about 2 hours away from the pacific-facing city of Antofagasta. It's kind of in the middle of nowhere.

ESO, I imagine, is aware that this isn't exactly right around the corner for most applicants, and at least in my case, provided economy-class travel to and from the Observatory.

This included the flights to and from Europe at the start and end of the internship, as well as flights between Antofagasta and Santiago (you can choose to live in Santiago, e.g.), a private ESO bus between Antofagasta and the Observatory and private taxis between the airport and your accommodation in Santiago.

From Europe the journey to Santiago is roughly 13 hours at best (i.e. with direct flights). Flights between Santiago and Antofagasta are about 2 hours long, and the bus from Antofagasta to the Observatory is an additional 2 hours.
