Deep in a remote valley, a tribe of people lived in a village surrounded by
dense forests and towering mountains. They lived a simple, peaceful life, and
had heard tales of two mysterious lands that lay beyond their borders - one to
the east, and one to the west. These lands were known as the Forbidden Lands,
and it was said that anyone who ventured too far into them would never return
the same.

Despite the warnings, some of the tribe's young people were consumed by a
burning curiosity about what lay beyond their home. They began to sneak out of
the village, venturing first to the east and then to the west, in search of
adventure, knowledge and perhaps even treasure. But what they found in the
Forbidden Lands was far beyond anything they could have imagined.

The forbidden land to the east was said to be ancient and steeped in tradition,
where the young people who ventured there returned with stories of ancient
wisdom and insight. The forbidden land to the west, however, was uncharted and
filled with unknown possibilities, where the young people who ventured there
returned with valuable resources and new technologies.

Most of the young people who ventured into the forbidden lands returned, but
they came back broken, unable to reintegrate into society, almost addicted to
the forbidden land. Only a rare few managed to find a perfect balance, bringing
back valuable resources and knowledge, and it was these individuals who truly
benefited the village.

For the tribe, the village represented a sense of presence and tangibility. The
benefits of remaining in the village were clear to them, and the villagers
enjoyed a peaceful life with their loved ones, surrounded by the beauty of
nature. But the forbidden lands always called out to them, reminding them of the
unknown and the vastness of the world beyond their village.
