The ongoing [2019 Chilean Protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Chilean_protests) will go down in the country's history as perhaps one of the biggest happenings since the fall of the Pinochet regime in 1990. Here, I try to take a more quantitative look at the events.

- Participants (_who_ is saying what?)
- Origins/Spread (_where_ and _how_ did it start?)
  - Social Media

- World relevance (_when_ did the world start catching on?)
