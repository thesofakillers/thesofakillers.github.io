This essay is about this post of mine from X dot com the everything app:

{{< x user="thelokasiffers" id="1855651780685603268" >}}

Let me build my thesis step by step, in case the 240-character limit of X dot
com made it unclear:

1. First, I make a simplifying definition: "Science" is the process of
   describing reality, where describing means finding models that reliably
   explain and predict physical phenomena.
2. Further simplifying, I assume that the set of models to describe reality is
   finite, so that at some stage it is possible to completely describe reality,
   i.e. to "solve" science, at least in the limit.
3. If this is true, then any science-faring civilization will ultimately reach
   "science-completeness", the state described in the previous point. This is
   assuming
   1. Eventual progress in the long run (i.e. no
      [great-filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter)-like events,
      recovery from dark ages, etc.).
   2. Sufficient if not infinite time for doing so -- we are working in terms of
      limits.
4. If this is true, then this means that any two science-complete civilizations
   will converge to the same set of models (perhaps expressed differently, but
   ultimately equivalent). In the absense of multiple civilizations, the point
   can be expressed as: In terms of science, the end state is identical for any
   science-faring civilization that fits the assumptions above.
5. Scientific knowledge is thus necessarily **universal, non-rival, and
   non-excludable**. The same fact "belongs" to reality, not to its first
   discoverer. There is a human _story_ for how Maxwell's equations were
   established, but the physics they describe is not exclusive to humans, it is
   the same for everyone. Who discovered it first is arbitrary, the universe
   does not care about copyright and ownership.
6. What remains distinctive for a species, then, is everything **not fixed by
   those universal models**—the stories, aesthetics, value-hierarchies, rituals
   unique to a civilization. Call that remainder **culture = civilisation mod
   science**. In the limit, it is the only domain where contributions are truly
   non-redundant and therefore the deepest expression of what it means to be
   _this_ civilisation—indeed, to be human.

## Objection Gauntlet

If you're happy with just agreeing with what I've said so far, you can skip to
the next section. If you have some objections, I'll try to pre-empt some of them
here.

(todo: objection gauntlet)

## The remainder of science-completeness

What exactly remains after we achieve science-completeness? If scientific
knowledge is universal, non-rival, and non-excludable then the distinctiveness
of any given civilization, what makes that civilization that civilization, must
ultimately lie entirely outside the scope of science.

I sort of hand-wave this remainder into the term "culture". I do concede that's
a generous bundling, but when I think about it I find that the word mostly does
capture what goes on in a civilization outside of science-doing.

To convince myself of this, I found it useful to think of the "types of doing"
that can be done. There's of course the obvious ones, like making art and
telling stories. These alone already cover so much. Design, architecture, music,
film, and entire industries fall under the former; religion, and even the real
stories of civilizations (history) fall under the latter[^1].

[^1]:
    Interestingly this implies that the history of science -- the stories behind
    how scientific discoveries were made -- is part of a civilization's cultural
    heritage. I think this can be possible while still marginalizing the science
    itself as non-cultural.

There are then the less obvious candidates: politics, for example, or law. These
too, appear to me to ultimately be cultural, built upon shared understandings of
fairness, justice, authority, and freedom. Science can tell us little about
whether democracy is preferable to monarchy, or whether property rights should
take precedence over social welfare. Those questions are fundamentally tied to
the context that bears them, anchored in the values of the citizens that
constructed those fields, not universal physical truths.

I struggled a bit when it came to engineering. Engineering is _not_ about
discovering the nature of reality. Engineering is about solving problems using
our knowledge of reality. I came to the conclusion that engineering, too can be
viewed as part of culture because it is an artesanal practice: there are design
decisions, preferences and taste built into any engineering project. Because of
this, the engineering feats of one civilization will probably look different in
many ways to those of another, despite possibly solving the same problems.

In general, I'm not sure this remainder is perfect -- there are probably aspects
of a civilization that fall neither under culture nor science and it's wasted
effort to try to force everything into one of the two. But I was surprised to
see how well the boundary worked.

The point I want to drive is this: in the long run, every civilization's
scientific achievements will overlap completely. There is only one set of
universal truths to discover. The artifacts and practices that will remain
distinctive, meaningful, and genuinely unique to a civilization, and will
ultimately define it, will therefore inevitably be largely if not entirely
cultural in nature.

## We can't afford to exclusively culture-max yet

(defining the technical debt thing, addressing possible interpretation of
anti-science sentiment, why we must keep doing science now, talk about
present-day dynamics between stems and humanities/arts today)

## Conclusion - What comes after science completeness

(talk about cities, implications for the question of "how do we find meaning
after work", what motivates me etc, what to do for culture today in the present)

## Appendix

### Engineering

(engineering is artesanal, simplifying -- engineering is _how_ we use science to
solve problems -- there is a story, there is design, there are preferences
(taste), this is culture.)

### Anthropocentrism

(why does meaning necessarily need to be derived from things uniquely human?
idk)

### Is this just the Singularity?

(kinda? i feel like this is the end state of the singularity, which in my mind
is the moment a civilization (or the universe) gets the intelligence explosion
which would ultimately culminate in "solving" science.)
