This essay is about this post of mine from X dot com the everything app:

{{< x user="thelokasiffers" id="1855651780685603268" >}}

Let me build my thesis step by step, in case the 240-character limit of X dot
com made it unclear:

1. First, I make a simplifying definition: "Science" is the process of
   describing reality, where describing means finding models that reliably
   explain and predict physical phenomena.
2. Further simplifying, I assume that the set of models to describe reality is
   finite, so that at some stage it is possible to completely describe reality,
   i.e. to "solve" science, at least in the limit.
3. If this is true, then any science-faring civilization will ultimately reach
   "science-completeness", the state described in the previous point. This is
   assuming
   1. Eventual progress in the long run (i.e. no
      [great-filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter)-like events,
      recovery from dark ages, etc.).
   2. Sufficient if not infinite time for doing so -- we are working in terms of
      limits.
4. If this is true, then this means that any two science-complete civilizations
   will converge to the same set of models (perhaps expressed differently, but
   ultimately equivalent). In the absense of multiple civilizations, the point
   can be expressed as: In terms of science, the end state is identical for any
   science-faring civilization that fits the assumptions above.
5. Scientific knowledge is thus necessarily **universal, non-rival, and
   non-excludable**. The same fact "belongs" to reality, not to its first
   discoverer. There is a human _story_ for how Maxwell's equations were
   established, but the physics they describe is not exclusive to humans, it is
   the same for everyone. Who discovered it first is arbitrary, the universe
   does not care about copyright and ownership.
6. What remains distinctive for a species, then, is everything **not fixed by
   those universal models**—the stories, aesthetics, value-hierarchies, rituals
   unique to a civilization. Call that remainder **culture = civilisation mod
   science**. In the limit, it is the only domain where contributions are truly
   non-redundant and therefore the deepest expression of what it means to be
   _this_ civilisation—indeed, to be human.

## Objection Gauntlet

If you're happy with just agreeing with what I've said so far, you can skip to
the next section. If you have some objections, I'll try to pre-empt some of them
here.

(todo: objection gauntlet)

## The remainder of science-completeness

(defining culture, the derivation of meaning and what it means to be human and
why therefore only culture matters in the limit)

## We can't afford to exclusively culture-max yet

(defining the technical debt thing, addressing possible interpretation of
anti-science sentiment, why we must keep doing science now, talk about
present-day dynamics between stems and humanities/arts today)

## Conclusion - What comes after science completeness

(talk about cities, implications for the question of "how do we find meaning
after work", what motivates me etc, what to do for culture today in the present)

## Appendix

### Engineering

(engineering is artesanal, simplifying -- engineering is _how_ we use science to
solve problems -- there is a story, there is design, there are preferences
(taste), this is culture.)

### Anthropocentrism

(why does meaning necessarily need to be derived from things uniquely human?
idk)

### Is this just the Singularity?

(kinda? i feel like this is the end state of the singularity, which in my mind
is the moment a civilization (or the universe) gets the intelligence explosion
which would ultimately culminate in "solving" science.)
