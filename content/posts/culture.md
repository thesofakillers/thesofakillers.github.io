This essay is about this post of mine from X dot com the everything app:

{{< x user="thelokasiffers" id="1855651780685603268" >}}

Let me build my thesis step by step, in case the 240-character limit of X dot
com made it unclear:

1. First, I make a simplifying definition: "Science" is the process of
   describing reality, where describing means finding models that reliably
   explain and predict physical phenomena.
2. Further simplifying, I assume that the set of models to describe reality is
   finite, so that at some stage it is possible to completely describe reality,
   i.e. to "solve" science, at least in the limit.
3. If this is true, then any science-faring civilization will ultimately reach
   "science-completeness", the state described in the previous point. This is
   assuming
   1. Eventual progress in the long run (i.e. no
      [great-filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter)-like events,
      recovery from dark ages, etc.).
   2. Sufficient if not infinite time for doing so -- we are working in terms of
      limits.
4. If this is true, then this means that any two science-complete civilizations
   will converge to the same set of models (perhaps expressed differently, but
   ultimately equivalent). In the absence of multiple civilizations, the point
   can be expressed as: In terms of science, the end state is identical for any
   science-faring civilization that fits the assumptions above.
5. Scientific knowledge is thus necessarily **universal, non-rival, and
   non-excludable**. The same fact "belongs" to reality, not to its first
   discoverer. There is a human _story_ for how Maxwell's equations were
   established, but the physics they describe is not exclusive to humans, it is
   the same for everyone. Who discovered it first is arbitrary, the universe
   does not care about copyright and ownership.
6. What remains distinctive for a species, then, is everything **not fixed by
   those universal models**—the stories, aesthetics, value-hierarchies, rituals
   unique to a civilization. Call that remainder **culture = civilisation mod
   science**. In the limit, it is the only domain where contributions are truly
   non-redundant and therefore the deepest expression of what it means to be
   _this_ civilisation—indeed, to be human.

## Objection Gauntlet

If you're happy with just agreeing with what I've said so far, you can skip to
the next section. If you have some objections, I'll try to pre-empt some of them
here.

(todo: objection gauntlet)

## The remainder of science-completeness

Once scientific knowledge is complete, any civilization will share the same
fundamental understanding of reality. The distinctiveness of any civilization,
therefore, must lie beyond that universally fixed knowledge—specifically in its
**culture**.

Culture, as I define it here, includes those aspects of civilization that arise
from subjective experience, shared values, and historical narratives rather than
objective descriptions of reality. It is almost everything else that we do that
isn't merely a natural consequence of physical laws. Think of:

- **Artistic Expression:** Art, design, music, literature, architecture—all
  human creations expressing subjective preferences and aesthetic values.
- **Narrative and Identity:** History, mythology, religion,
  traditions—storytelling forms that bind communities and define collective
  identities.
- **Social Constructs:** Politics, law, morality—systems fundamentally built on
  subjective interpretations of justice, fairness, authority, and community
  values.

While this definition might still feel broad, the key distinction is
straightforward: **culture is what science alone cannot predict**. Cultural
outputs are inherently subjective, context-dependent, and reflective of
arbitrary choices of its creators rather than universal truth.

This clarification allows us to precisely restate our thesis: in the long-term
future of scientific completeness, culture alone remains unique to any given
civilization.

## We can't afford to exclusively culture-max yet

If I value meaning and I ascribe meaning to identity, and my identity is defined
by my cultural outputs, then I should just culture-max my life right? In fact,
we should _all_ just be making art and going to museums and writing novels and
cooking food in a never ending fantastic celebration of humanity, right? And
this as a call to abandon science, an anti-STEM manifesto undermining the value
of scientific endeavors, right?

THIS IS NOT WHAT THIS ESSAY IS SAYING!

As great as that sounds, there is a reason I have specifically framed the thesis
as "in the limit" -- we are simply not there yet. Curiosity aside, there is a
very pragmatic reason why we do science today: we are in a situation of
"technical debt" with respect to our understanding of reality. There are
essentially many many holes in our physical models such that we still not able
to address much of the problems the blight our existence today. Health, energy,
climate, food security, population, scarcity -- these are all problems waiting
for technical solutions we do not yet have.

Until we have bridged that gap, we cannot afford to exclusively culture-max --
we would not survive doing so. Note briefly that this does not mean that the
opposite is true either -- if we exclusively hill-climbed science we would be
left with no culture to identify us[^1]. That feels like a cop-out, but I'm just
observing what I notice here in case others have not, I am not trying to
prescribe something new.

[^1]:
    Interestingly, this tension I think explains some of the dynamics I see
    between more STEM-oriented and more culture/humanities-oriented people
    today. The STEMcels assume an air of superiority, fueled by the almost-fact
    that they are actually "contributing" to the world, supposedly addressing
    that technical debt. While this is in part true, I think there is component
    of cope here, jealous of possibly more soulful lives their less productive
    counterparts lead. On the flipside, the humanormies assume an air of je m'en
    fiche, facing the fact that they are working on borrowed time to cope with
    the associated guilt. I'm not making this up, I've seen and experienced this
    first hand in conversations with many people from both camps. Of course it's
    not always like this and the most mature (not necessarily older!) do not
    fall into these traps, but it is surprisingly common.

    PS: I think this is also explains in part why people in the arts are
    generally seen as "cooler": not only are they naughtily ignoring the
    technical debt (there's an element to transgression to that) but they are
    genuinely producing things truly unique to them and to us as a civilization,
    as a species.

## Conclusion - What comes after science completeness

(

- implications for the question of "how do we find meaning after work
- Consider cities after the singularity. Today, we flock to urban centers for
  careers, opportunities, economic necessity. Tomorrow, freed from such
  constraints, we'll be drawn by something else entirely: the vibe, the scene,
  the particular cultural texture that makes Rome different from Zurich, that
  makes your neighborhood bar irreplaceable despite serving the same beer as
  everywhere else, that makes a language feel like an intrinsic part of who you
  are rather than just a means of communication.
- Use cultural output as a measure of wealth (since once all science is solved,
  the field is leveled)
- what motivates me: i think we'll be able to gradually take our foot off the
  gas of the science machine as we get closer to science completeness, and ease
  into culture-max. I take pleasure in impactfully moving us towards that
  direction of fluorishing. and i also let this motivate my hobbies and
  interests.
- what to do for culture today -- avoid globalisation into monoculture, Resist
  the flattening, protect culture, engage in it, create it, curate it. cultural
  output not automatically good quality. beauty in eye of beholder up to a
  certain extent. be cool to study this. maybe after the singularity.

## Appendix

### Engineering

(what about engineering? tough to say. what i came to is. engineering is
artesanal, simplifying -- engineering is _how_ we use science to solve problems
-- there is a story, there is design, there are preferences (taste), this is
culture. not sure im convinced but maybe theres something there.)

### Anthropocentrism

(why does meaning necessarily need to be derived from things uniquely human?
idk)

### Is this just the Singularity?

(kinda? i feel like this is the end state of the singularity, which in my mind
is the moment a civilization (or the universe) gets the intelligence explosion
which would ultimately culminate in "solving" science.)
